<h1>Hello There...</h1>

<p>ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tim! I am a network engineer that is trying to learn how to code! I think I'll try python so that I can script in ansible. I'm working towards some network 
automation tools and I suppose I'll see what I come up with! Wish me luck!<p>

<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
As I mentioned, I work in networking at a company called Techex! Also, I run a streaming channel on the side. Feel 
free to check it out <a href="https://www.torresthestreamingbull.com/">here</a>!</p>

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in networking, music, and gaming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ansible
